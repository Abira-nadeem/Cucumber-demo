--- INTRODUCTION ---

This project is used to demonstrate UI automation by using Cucumber by inserting data into the fields, verifying login test, and performing click action by creating 
indiviual feature files, then stepdefinations and afterwards a runner class to run the test cases.
In feature files gherkin langauge(Feature,Scenario,Given,When,Then)is used, after generating results from this class we can write the java code for automation under 
the step definations , then in then runner class we can run the code to see the results and generate cucumber reports in html or json format.
